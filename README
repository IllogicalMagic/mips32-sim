make clean

To link libmips:
CROSS_COMPILER=<cross-compiler-folder>/mips-elf-gcc
CROSS_TOOLCHAIN=<cross-compiler-folder> make
CROSS_PREFIX=mipsel-elf-

Then,
<define variables> make

Depends on elfio library, library folder 'elfio' should be copied to repository root
OR: 
    use this before make: ADDOPTS=-I$PATH_TO_ELFIO

To compile source code into elf, use 
    SIM=<repo-folder>
    <cross-compiler-folder>/mips-elf-gcc -L$SIM/lib -lmips -EL
Assembler file:
    <cross-compiler-folder>/mips-elf-gcc <source.c> -S -o <result.s>
    
There are two modes (and respective files in main/):
    appmode --raw <elf-file>
    To run applications (elf-files)
    
    simulator --raw <binary>
    With all exceptions/tlb features
    To get binary, one need:
        ./asm.py <asm-file.s> <binary>
